## Description
This project is a simple budget calculator for a TA student. The calculator calculates the amount of hours they need to work to cover their living expenses. The program accounts for the cost of the following items:

- $625 monthly rent for a local apartment
- $27 monthly internet service
- $250 monthly grocery bill
- $150 monthly 'fun' allowance - funds to be used for leisurely activities

The program performs the following:

- Calculate the amount of hours the student will have to work to afford the monthly expenses listed above.

- Calculate how many hours the student will have to work to include an additional savings of $100 per month. 

## Output
Lastly, the program outputs the following information:

- hourly wage which is $10
- each monthly item expense
- total monthly expenses
- how many hours per week the student would have to work to break even (spend the same amount they earn)
- how many hours the student would have to work to save $100 a month after paying all expenses

## How to Run
1. Compile and run the program using your preferred Java IDE or command line.
2. Review the printed output for all the budget calculations.
