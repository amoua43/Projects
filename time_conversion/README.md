# A Non-Conventional Time Conversion

## Description 
This program is designed for time conversion and consists of two classes. The first class, **TimeConversionDriver**, prompts the user to input a number representing seconds, which will then be converted into different units of time. The second class, **TimeConversion**, performs the actual calculations. It includes five methods to convert seconds into decaseconds, jiffies, New York minutes, nanocenturies, and scaramuccis.

## Output
A working program will:

- Allow the user to enter a whole number
- A description of a decasecond and the number converted to decaseconds
- A description of a jiffy and the number converted to jiffies
- A description of a new york minute and the number converted to new york minutes
- A description of a nanocentury and the number converted to nanocenturies
- A description of a scaramucci and the number converted to scaramuccis

## How to Run
1. Compile and run the program using your preferred Java IDE or command line.
2. Review the printed output for all the time conversion calculations.
