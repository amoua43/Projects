# Projects

This repository serves as a space where I can display and store my school projects/labs that I found interesting and fun to code at the time.
These are small projects/labs that have simple outputs. I enjoyed coding these labs/projects the most. 

Note that most of these projects have to be in a separate file/folder to run.
